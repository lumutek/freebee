# freebee [test 2]
This Android app is currently in development under MIT open-source licensing. 
The purpose of this app is to create a mobile platform that facilitates the real-time listing of 
resource opportunities and their location, the efficient distribution of free/low-cost goods
and/or services, and the gathering of user rating data for the purpose of optimizing the reliability, 
efficiency, and usefulness of the app.

The app involves a listings page, a mapview page, an information upload page, and a login page. 
Currently, the user interface is being refined, database and maps functionality is being developed,
and code is being written to link listings to map locations. Ratings functionality has not yet been 
developed.

As of 03/30/2020, development group members include: 
Lukas D. Mueller (Lead),
Conan Minihan,
Nathan Kindt,
Praj Mohan

The project is expected to have several contributers under the MIT open-source license.


To open the app on PC, download and install Android Studio. Also, download the freebee repository as a zip. 
On a PC, unzip the download and copy the freebee folder inside it to the C:/Users/[username]/AndroidStudioProjects directory. 
Download Flutter for Windows, specifying a custom install directory in C:, such as "src". You will then also need to configure Android SDK to use the C:/src/flutter/bin). 
In Android Studio, first make sure that the Flutter and Dart plugins have been downloaded in the SDK manager. 
In Tools>SDK Manager under the SDK Tools tab, make sure to uncheck the box next to “Hide Obsolete Packages”, and check the boxes next to the following:

•	NDK Side-by-Side

•	Android SDK tools (Obsolete)

•	Google Play Services

Then, select File>New> Import Project, specifying the “freebee” folder that was copied to the AndroidStudioProjects directory. 
Once the project is open, along with a suitable Android emulator, build/run the project. Android studios may require you to update packages and/or dependencies, but should prompt for it if necessary.
