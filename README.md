Helping us live through the hard times, and thrive through the good times.

# freebee [test 2]
This Android app is currently in development under MIT open-source licensing. 
The purpose of this app is to create a mobile platform that facilitates the real-time listing of 
resource opportunities and their location, the efficient distribution of free/low-cost goods
and/or services, and the gathering of user rating data for the purpose of optimizing the reliability, 
efficiency, and usefulness of the app.

The app involves a listings page, a mapview page, an information upload page, and a login page. 
Currently, the user interface is being refined, database and maps functionality is being developed,
and code is being written to link listings to map locations. Ratings functionality has not yet been 
developed.

Code contributors, as of 03/30/2020, include: 
Lukas D. Mueller 

The project is expected to have several contributers under the MIT open-source license.
